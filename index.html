            <p>
              The Welsh Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in
              Wales. The name "corgi" is derived from the Welsh words "cor" and
              "ci", meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively. Two separate breeds
              are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh
              Corgi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Physically, the Cardigan and Pembroke are both dwarf breeds with
              large heads and heavy, long bodies on short, thick legs. They both
              have upright ears, although the Cardigan’s are larger and more
              rounded, and their double-coated fur requires little grooming
              besides regular bathing and brushing.

          <p>
            Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh
            Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is
            affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one the
            world's most popular herding breeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built
            male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but
            powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a
            hard day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly
            quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan,
            with or without white markings.

        <h2>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
          <p>
            The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art:
            Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly suited to moving cattle, and
            yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished
            companion even if it never did a day's work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone, short legs, and a deep chest,
            Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace. Cardis
            can weigh anywhere from 25 to 34 pounds, with females at the lower
            end of the scale. They come in several coat colors, from red to the
            popular blue-merle pattern.

            They may have similar names and even more similar looks, but the
            Pembroke Welsh corgi and the Cardigan Welsh corgi are not actually
            related at all. Both dogs hale from Wales, where they helped farmers
            heard cattle. But they come from different parts of Wales, and the
            Cardigan is about two thousand years older than the Pembroke.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cardigan Welsh Corgis have a wider range of coat colors. Pembroke
            Welsh Corgis are limited to sable, red, and tricolor. Cardigans, on
            the other hand, can be brindle, black and white with tan or brindle,
            blue merle, or red and sable with white. Still not seeing a
            difference? Just look at the rear. Pembroke corgis usually have
            their tail docked as short as possible, while Cardigans retain their
            tail. That’s a difference that’s hard to miss.

        <h2>Similarities</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
          <p>
            Both Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh corgis are happy, loving dogs who
            would make great additions to many families, but that doesn’t mean
            they’re a perfect match for yours. It’s important to weigh the pros
            and cons of corgis in general before deciding between the Pembroke
            and Cardigan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, remember that Cardigan and Pembroke corgi owners must take
            precautions to avoid back injuries. Jumping is dangerous, including
            on and off of furniture, and they should avoid stairs whenever
            possible. If you live in a multi-story home, bringing home a corgi
            might introduce a few new complications.
